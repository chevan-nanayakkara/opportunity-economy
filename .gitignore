# .GITIGNORE TEMPLATE
# ==============================================
# Updated: January 16, 2026
#
# DEFAULT: This template assumes a DOCUMENTATION REPOSITORY
# Most repos are documentation repos until they need code/dependencies.
#
# ==============================================
# WHAT TYPE OF REPOSITORY IS THIS?
# ==============================================
#
# 1. DOCUMENTATION REPOSITORY (DEFAULT - Most repos are this)
#    Characteristics:
#    • Markdown, PDF, Word documents, presentations
#    • Strategy, research, analysis, planning documents
#    • No code execution, no dependencies, no build process
#    • Examples: strategic-vision, market-research, business-plans
#    • Uses: Sections 1-8 of this file (as-is)
#
# 2. OPERATIONAL REPOSITORY (Content + Versioned Outputs)
#    Characteristics:
#    • Documentation PLUS versioned templates, forms, exports
#    • SOPs, runbooks, processes, team playbooks
#    • Fillable PDFs, Word/Excel templates you want to track
#    • No code execution (yet), but tracks generated artifacts
#    • Examples: company-operations, client-onboarding, team-handbook
#    • Uses: Sections 1-8, MODIFY section 7 (see instructions there)
#
# 3. DEVELOPMENT REPOSITORY (Code That Executes)
#    Characteristics:
#    • Source code files (JavaScript, Python, etc.)
#    • Dependencies (node_modules/, venv/, package.json)
#    • Build/compile process (dist/, build/)
#    • Runtime environment (.env files, configs)
#    • Examples: company-website, automation-tools, data-pipelines
#    • Uses: Sections 1-9, UNCOMMENT section 9 (development dependencies)
#
# ==============================================
# DECISION TREE: What should I do?
# ==============================================
#
# START HERE: What's in this repository?
#
# ├─ Only documents? (Markdown, Word, PDFs, strategy, research)
# │  ├─ Do you track generated PDFs/exports? NO
# │  │  └─ ✓ DOCUMENTATION REPO (default)
# │  │     Action: Use as-is, sections 1-8
# │  │
# │  └─ Do you track generated PDFs/exports? YES (templates, forms)
# │     └─ ✓ OPERATIONAL REPO
# │        Action: Go to section 7, COMMENT OUT the patterns for files you track
# │        Examples: Comment out *.pdf, *.docx, exports/ if you version them
# │
# └─ Contains code that executes? (Scripts, automation, applications)
#    └─ ✓ DEVELOPMENT REPO
#       Action: Go to section 9, UNCOMMENT your language's dependencies
#       Examples: Uncomment node_modules/ for JS, __pycache__/ for Python
#
# ==============================================
# WHEN REPOS EVOLVE (How to transition)
# ==============================================
#
# Documentation → Operational:
# When: You start tracking template outputs (PDFs, forms, exports)
# Action: Modify section 7 (comment out what you want to track)
#
# Documentation → Development:
# When: You add scripts, automation, or code with dependencies
# Action: Uncomment section 9 for your language
#
# Operational → Development:
# When: You add automation scripts or tools to your operational docs
# Action: Uncomment section 9 for your language
# Note: Keep section 7 modifications (still track templates)

# ==============================================
# Applies to: Documentation and Development repos (default excludes)
#
# ⚠️ OPERATIONAL REPOS: ACTION REQUIRED!
# If this is an OPERATIONAL repo that tracks templates/exports,
# COMMENT OUT the patterns below for files you want to version control.
#
# Common operational use cases:
# - Track fillable PDF forms → Comment out: *.pdf
# - Track Word templates → Comment out: *.docx
# - Track Excel templates → Comment out: *.xlsx
# - Track generated reports → Comment out: exports/
# - Track presentation templates → Comment out: *.pptx
#
# Documentation repos: Leave as-is (don't track generated exports)
# Operational repos: Modify as needed (track versioned templates)
# Development repos: Leave as-is (don't track build outputs)

# Content transforms
*.rendered.md
*.export.*

# Exports folder (contains generated reports, outputs)

generated/

# PDFs (generated documents)
# OPERATIONAL: Comment this out if you track PDF templates

# Applies to: DEVELOPMENT repos only
# Default: Keep this section COMMENTED (most repos are documentation)
#
# ⚠️ DEVELOPMENT REPOS: ACTION REQUIRED!

# ✓ Adding scripts with dependencies (npm install, pip install)
# ✓ Adding build processes or compilation
# ✓ Adding automated tools or utilities
# ✓ Adding data processing pipelines
# ✓ Adding APIs or integrations
#
# Operational → Development transition:
# When you add automation scripts to an operational repo,
# uncomment the relevant section below AND keep section 7 modifications
# (you still want to track your templates while excluding dependencies)
