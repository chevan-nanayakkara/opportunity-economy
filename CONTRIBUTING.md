# Contributing to The Opportunity Economy

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this collaborative policy development project! This agenda succeeds through technical expertise applied at scale, and we welcome contributions from policy experts, advocates, researchers, and engaged citizens who want to build capitalism that works for everyone.

## Our Mission

We're building **The Opportunity Economy** through detailed, technical policy work that creates systematic wealth-building opportunities for all Americans. Our goal is making capitalism work for opportunity creation across all levels of society rather than wealth concentration at the top.

**Core Principle**: "Competition Cures All" and "Democracy and Capitalism: two great tastes that go great together."
