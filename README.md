# The Opportunity Economy
*Building Capitalism That Works for Everyone Through Strategic Policy*

A collaborative platform for developing comprehensive policy solutions that create genuine wealth-building opportunities for all Americans through the framework of Opportunity Economics.

> "Competition Cures All" and "Democracy and Capitalism: two great tastes that go great together."

## Vision

This agenda is built on the belief that we can create **The Opportunity Economy**—where everyone has genuine opportunities to build wealth and control their economic lives. The problem isn't capitalism itself—it's that corporate interests have captured our economic systems to extract wealth rather than create opportunities.

**Something fundamental has broken in American capitalism**—or rather, it's working exactly as designed, just not for you. We're told the economy is growing, but working people and families struggle to build wealth despite doing everything right—working hard, saving money, buying homes. Meanwhile, corporate profits soar while products are designed to break faster than ever before. Your smartphone dies after three years, your washing machine fails right after the warranty expires, and your car needs expensive repairs at 80,000 miles. Each time you're forced to replace something, you get poorer while wealth flows directly into the pockets of corporate executives and major shareholders.

**This isn't market failure—it's market design.** These aren't natural economic laws but deliberate political choices made over decades to benefit corporate interests at the expense of working people and families. [Economic theories and arrangements change throughout history](https://chevan.info/evolution-of-economic-ideas-insights-into-major-schools-of-thought/)—the current system was designed by people with power to serve people with power, but that means we can redesign it to serve everyone else.

## The Urgency: Why We Can't Wait for Perfect Conditions

Many people frustrated with neoliberalism retreat into what we might call "political bypass"—avoiding direct engagement with national policy in favor of waiting for systemic collapse or focusing exclusively on small-scale local solutions. Whether it's anti-capitalists hoping for economic breakdown or progressives concentrating only on community gardens and local cooperatives, this retreat from national political engagement has a fatal flaw: **while you're avoiding "dirty" politics or waiting for perfect conditions, a powerful coalition of authoritarian, fascist, religious nationalist, oligarch, racist, and bigoted elements are actively organizing to control national policy.**

This authoritarian coalition understands that real power comes from controlling federal resources, monetary policy, and regulatory frameworks. They're not waiting for perfect conditions or retreating to local solutions—they're systematically capturing the institutions that determine how trillions of dollars get allocated and how economic rules get written.

Meanwhile, working people and families suffer through the dysfunction you're trying to avoid engaging with. They lose wealth to planned obsolescence, struggle with economic insecurity, and watch their communities decline while others focus on local solutions that can't address problems requiring national-scale resources.

**We need to build an equally powerful coalition around policies that enhance capitalism for working people and families rather than just corporate interests.** Opportunity Economics offers the framework for this coalition: economic policies that appeal across traditional political lines because they create genuine opportunities for everyone, regardless of their cultural values or political beliefs.

## The Opportunity Economics Approach

**Core Theory**: Economic systems produce the outcomes they're designed to produce. We can redesign capitalism to work for opportunity creation across all levels of society rather than wealth concentration at the top.

**Goal**: Use federal resources to help working people and families, small businesses, and communities build wealth and control their economic development, rather than letting corporate interests extract wealth while people struggle.

This is fundamentally about inclusion and dismantling existing hierarchies that exclude people from economic and political power. We guarantee a minimum standard of living with dignity for all, which frees everyone else to pursue prosperity and innovation without artificial constraints.

## Beyond Left vs. Right: Building a Broad Coalition

Opportunity Economics transcends traditional political divisions because it addresses what people actually experience: an economy that seems rigged against anyone who works for a living. This isn't about left versus right politics—**it's about building a broad coalition that moves beyond both failed neoliberalism and corporate-captured politics that have dominated both parties for decades.**

Both Republicans and Democrats have been trapped in a neoliberal framework that serves corporate interests rather than working people and families. Republican "free market" rhetoric often masks corporate welfare and monopoly protection, while Democratic "progressive" policies frequently get watered down by corporate donors and lobbyists. Neither party has offered a systematic alternative that actually makes capitalism work for wealth creation across all levels of society.

**The beauty of Opportunity Economics is that it unites people across party lines around shared economic interests:**
- **A Republican small business owner** struggling against corporate monopolies
- **A Democratic suburban parent** losing wealth to products designed to break  
- **An independent rural family** worried about economic security
- **An urban worker** wanting genuine opportunities

All benefit from the same systematic changes that serve people's actual interests rather than corporate donors or ideological purity. Whether you're a frustrated Republican tired of crony capitalism, a Democrat disappointed by corporate-captured "progressivism," or an independent who wants practical solutions, Opportunity Economics provides systematic reforms that serve your interests without requiring you to abandon your cultural values or political identity.

## Understanding How Our Economic System Actually Works

**Money Is Not Scarce - Productive Capacity Is What Matters**: Since 1971, when President Nixon ended the gold standard, money has functioned as a tool we create to coordinate economic activity rather than a scarce resource that limits what's possible. The federal government doesn't need to "find" money to fund strong national systems—it creates money, just as it does for military spending and corporate subsidies.

When politicians say "we can't afford it," they're either misunderstanding how our monetary system works or deliberately misleading you. **The real constraints are whether we have enough workers, materials, and organizational capacity, not whether the government has enough money in its accounts.** We clearly have millions of people who want to work, materials sitting unused, and organizational capacity going to waste while communities struggle with inadequate resources.

This understanding completely changes what's possible. We live in an economy of potential abundance, not scarcity. The "tough choices" politicians talk about are artificial—designed to maintain power structures, not reflecting actual economic limits.

**Technical Policy Mechanisms Transfer Wealth Upward**: Many of these policy mechanisms have been working quietly in the background of our governance for decades, known only to bureaucrats, politicians, and corporate lobbyists. **The Opportunity Economy** is about connecting these systems to voter activity so you can be part of consciously making them work for you and demanding they be enhanced rather than captured by corporate interests.

Take depreciation rules—they're not dramatic or sensational, but they directly impact your ability to build wealth. When businesses get tax deductions for equipment depreciation while families get nothing for cars and appliances that break by design, that's a specific policy choice that transfers wealth upward. Understanding and changing these kinds of technical details is how we make capitalism work for everyone, not just those who already have wealth and lobbyists.

## The Four Pillars of Opportunity Economics

### Pillar 1: Use Our Full Economic Capacity for Real Opportunity

**The Problem**: We're told there's "no money" for community development, infrastructure repair, or job training, while trillions flow to Wall Street bailouts and corporate subsidies.

**The Solution**: Deploy our actual productive capacity—workers, materials, organizational ability—to create opportunities where people live and work.

Here's the key insight that changes everything: Since 1971, money has functioned as a tool we create to coordinate economic activity rather than a scarce resource that limits what's possible. The federal government creates money, just as it does for military spending and corporate subsidies. **The real constraints are whether we have enough workers, materials, and organizational capacity, not artificial financial limitations.**

This means we can fund federal job guarantee programs creating opportunities in infrastructure, environmental restoration, community development, and care work. We can provide community-controlled resource allocation that serves local needs rather than distant corporate interests. We can base economic development on what we can actually build and accomplish, not artificial financial constraints.

### Pillar 2: Help Working Families Build Wealth, Not Just Survive

**The Problem**: Families work hard but lose wealth to planned obsolescence, healthcare profiteering, and housing speculation while businesses get tax breaks for their depreciation.

**The Solution**: Give working families the same systematic advantages that businesses already receive.

When businesses lose value on equipment, they subtract that depreciation from their taxes—reducing what they owe the government by thousands or millions annually. When working people lose value on cars, appliances, and electronics designed to break, they get nothing while corporate shareholders profit from replacement sales. **This isn't an accident or oversight—it's deliberate policy design that creates a massive barrier to wealth-building for working people and families while channeling profits into wealthy pockets.**

Think about it: your grandparents' 1960 refrigerator lasted 30 years, allowing them to build personal wealth over time. Today's refrigerator lasts 8 years by corporate design, forcing constant replacement that prevents wealth accumulation for working people and families while generating profits for wealthy shareholders. Our economic statistics celebrate this as "growth," but it's actually systematic wealth extraction disguised as market activity.

Opportunity Economics would provide working people and families depreciation credits recovering thousands annually from forced replacement costs. Community-controlled banking would serve local wealth building rather than Wall Street speculation. Market incentives would reward durability and value creation over designed failure. Universal basic assets would ensure everyone has access to productive tools and ownership stakes.

### Pillar 3: Community Control Over Economic Development

**The Problem**: Corporate interests and political insiders control economic development while communities have no real say in how their economies develop.

**The Solution**: Democratic institutions that coordinate economic development based on community needs and local priorities.

Here's what most people don't understand about local solutions: they're fundamentally constrained by the size and scale of the local economy—a community can only support as many cooperatives, sustainable building projects, or local enterprises as local income allows. But that local economy is dwarfed by the size and scale of the nation as the creator of currency.

When we retreat to purely local solutions, we're essentially choosing to work with the smallest possible resource pool while corporate interests freely access national-scale resources through depreciation deductions, subsidies, and favorable regulations. This is like trying to compete against Walmart with a neighborhood garage sale—the resource mismatch makes genuine competition impossible.

**Opportunity Economics doesn't replace local solutions—it powers them up.** Instead of forcing communities to choose between local control and adequate resources, we provide systematic federal support that enables genuine local autonomy. Communities get to decide how resources are used, but they're not artificially limited to whatever wealth already exists locally.

The key insight is simple: **Competition Cures All.** When markets actually function competitively rather than being rigged by monopolies and regulatory capture, they serve communities rather than extracting from them.

### Pillar 4: Economic Security and Political Inclusion That Enables Real Achievement

**The Problem**: Economic insecurity forces people to accept bad deals and prevents them from pursuing opportunities, starting businesses, or building community wealth. Meanwhile, political systems exclude most people from meaningful participation in decisions that affect their lives.

**The Solution**: Economic security and political inclusion as the foundation for genuine achievement and democratic participation.

**Economic security isn't the enemy of opportunity—it's the foundation that makes real opportunity possible.** When we provide foundational economic supports—healthcare, education, housing stability, and baseline income—we don't suppress ambition; we empower it. People are freed to take meaningful risks: to start businesses, pursue education, build community, or simply live in peace with quiet dignity. All of these are economically generative. Stability isn't stagnation—it's the precondition for motion.

But economic opportunity requires political inclusion. We need fair, transparent, and accountable political processes that give everyone genuine access to participate in decisions about economic policy. This means dismantling political hegemony over time and creating more choice for people to be part of the democratic process—from local community development to national economic planning.

When you have genuine competition in both markets and politics, with everyone included rather than excluded by existing hierarchies, both systems work better for everyone.

## Opportunity Caucus

The [Opportunity Caucus](./opportunity-caucus/) represents our organized approach for advancing opportunity-creating policies through Democratic Party channels while coordinating with broader cross-party coalition building, emphasizing economic common ground over political differences while building the political power necessary to counter both corporate capture and rising authoritarianism.

## Answering Common Objections

**"This sounds like socialism!"** Opportunity Economics is fundamentally capitalist—it just makes capitalism work for wealth creation across all levels of society rather than just wealth concentration at the top. We're not eliminating private property, market competition, or profit. We're ending the rigged game where only those with existing wealth and political connections can build more wealth. We're creating genuine market competition instead of corporate monopolization.

But here's what this requires from all of us: we have to actually learn how capitalism works and get involved in championing the detailed policies that enable us to make it work for regular people. Take depreciation rules—they're not dramatic or sensational, but they directly impact your ability to build wealth. When businesses get tax deductions for equipment depreciation while families get nothing for cars and appliances that break by design, that's a specific policy choice that transfers wealth upward.

**"Where will the money come from?"** The same place it comes from for military spending, corporate bailouts, and tax cuts for the wealthy—the federal government creates it. The question isn't whether we can afford Opportunity Economics, but whether we can afford to keep running an economy designed for wealth extraction rather than opportunity creation. The current system is costing us trillions in lost potential and human suffering.

**"Won't this cause inflation?"** Inflation happens when demand exceeds our productive capacity. Opportunity Economics focuses on expanding productive capacity through job guarantee programs, infrastructure development, and community wealth building. When you have more workers, better infrastructure, and more efficient production, you can produce more goods and services, which helps control inflation rather than causing it. The current system of artificial scarcity and planned obsolescence is what drives prices up.

**"This will never happen—the powerful interests won't allow it."** Every major economic transformation in American history faced this same objection. The New Deal, Social Security, Medicare—all were "impossible" until they weren't. Change happens when enough people understand that the current system is a choice, not a natural law, and organize to make different choices. That's exactly what Opportunity Economics provides: a clear alternative that appeals across political lines and offers immediate benefits that build toward systematic change.

## Building The Coalition We Need

The choice isn't between defending capitalism as it exists or waiting for it to collapse. Opportunity Economics offers a third way: building a broad coalition that breaks free from both neoliberal corporatism and authoritarian populism to reorganize our economy around genuine opportunity creation.

This coalition-building approach draws from the best of both Republican and Democratic traditions while rejecting their corporate capture. We can appeal to Republican values of entrepreneurship, genuine market competition, and individual freedom while rejecting crony capitalism and monopoly protection. We can appeal to Democratic values of economic opportunity, community empowerment, and systematic support for working people and families while rejecting corporate-captured incrementalism and bureaucratic inefficiency.

**The urgency is clear**: we need this coalition to defeat both establishment neoliberalism and rising authoritarianism. While corporate-captured politicians in both parties serve their donors and authoritarians use division to consolidate power, we can unite people around economic policies that actually improve their lives.
