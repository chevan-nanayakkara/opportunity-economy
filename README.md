# The Opportunity Economy
*Building Capitalism That Works for Everyone Through Strategic Policy*

A collaborative platform for developing comprehensive policy solutions that create genuine wealth-building opportunities for all Americans through the framework of Opportunity Economics.

> "Competition Cures All" and "Democracy and Capitalism: two great tastes that go great together."

## Vision

This agenda is built on the belief that we can create **The Opportunity Economy**‚Äîwhere everyone has genuine opportunities to build wealth and control their economic lives. The problem isn't capitalism itself‚Äîit's that corporate interests have captured our economic systems to extract wealth rather than create opportunities.

Something fundamental has broken in American capitalism‚Äîor rather, it's working exactly as designed, just not for you. We're told the economy is growing, but working people and families struggle to build wealth despite doing everything right. Meanwhile, corporate profits soar while products are designed to break faster than ever before.

This isn't market failure‚Äîit's market design. These aren't natural economic laws but deliberate political choices made over decades to benefit corporate interests at the expense of working people and families. We can redesign capitalism to serve everyone else.

## The Opportunity Economics Approach

**Core Theory**: Economic systems produce the outcomes they're designed to produce. We can redesign capitalism to work for opportunity creation across all levels of society rather than wealth concentration at the top.

**Goal**: Use federal resources to help working people and families, small businesses, and communities build wealth and control their economic development, rather than letting corporate interests extract wealth while people struggle.

This is fundamentally about inclusion and dismantling existing hierarchies that exclude people from economic and political power. We guarantee a minimum standard of living with dignity for all, which frees everyone else to pursue prosperity and innovation without artificial constraints.

## Beyond Left vs. Right: Building a Broad Coalition

Opportunity Economics transcends traditional political divisions because it addresses what people actually experience: an economy that seems rigged against anyone who works for a living. This isn't about left versus right politics‚Äîit's about building a broad coalition that moves beyond both failed neoliberalism and corporate-captured politics.

The beauty of Opportunity Economics is that it unites people across political lines around shared economic interests:
- A Republican small business owner struggling against corporate monopolies
- A suburban parent losing wealth to products designed to break  
- A rural family worried about economic security
- An urban worker wanting genuine opportunities

All benefit from the same systematic changes that serve people's actual interests rather than corporate donors or ideological purity.

## The Four Pillars of Opportunity Economics

### Pillar 1: Use Our Full Economic Capacity for Real Opportunity

**The Problem**: We're told there's "no money" for community development, infrastructure repair, or job training, while trillions flow to Wall Street bailouts and corporate subsidies.

**The Solution**: Deploy our actual productive capacity‚Äîworkers, materials, organizational ability‚Äîto create opportunities where people live and work.

Since 1971, money has functioned as a tool we create to coordinate economic activity rather than a scarce resource that limits what's possible. The federal government creates money, just as it does for military spending and corporate subsidies. The real constraints are whether we have enough workers, materials, and organizational capacity, not artificial financial limitations.

### Pillar 2: Help Working Families Build Wealth, Not Just Survive

**The Problem**: Families work hard but lose wealth to planned obsolescence, healthcare profiteering, and housing speculation while businesses get tax breaks for their depreciation.

**The Solution**: Give working families the same systematic advantages that businesses already receive.

When businesses lose value on equipment, they subtract that depreciation from their taxes. When working people lose value on cars, appliances, and electronics, they get nothing while corporate shareholders profit from replacement sales. This deliberate policy design creates massive barriers to wealth-building for families while channeling profits into wealthy pockets.

### Pillar 3: Community Control Over Economic Development

**The Problem**: Corporate interests and political insiders control economic development while communities have no real say in how their economies develop.

**The Solution**: Democratic institutions that coordinate economic development based on community needs and local priorities.

Local solutions are fundamentally constrained by the size of the local economy, but communities shouldn't be forced to choose between local control and adequate resources. Opportunity Economics provides systematic federal support that enables genuine local autonomy‚Äîcommunities decide how resources are used while accessing national-scale capacity.

### Pillar 4: Economic Security and Political Inclusion That Enables Real Achievement

**The Problem**: Economic insecurity forces people to accept bad deals and prevents them from pursuing opportunities, starting businesses, or building community wealth.

**The Solution**: Economic security and political inclusion as the foundation for genuine achievement and democratic participation.

Economic security isn't the enemy of opportunity‚Äîit's the foundation that makes real opportunity possible. When people have healthcare, education, housing security, and basic dignity guaranteed, they can take meaningful risks, start businesses, and engage in community development rather than just survive.

### Current Focus
- ‚úÖ **Consumer Depreciation Reform** - Complete framework for working family tax equity
- üèóÔ∏è **Community Development Banking** - Local wealth-building financial institutions  
- üìã **Federal Job Guarantee** - Systematic opportunity creation through productive work
- üìã **Antitrust Enforcement Reform** - Restoring genuine market competition

## From Framework to Action

**Start Now**: Working family depreciation credits, community development banking pilots, enhanced small business support

**Build Momentum**: Job guarantee demonstrations in rural and suburban areas, worker ownership support, systematic entrepreneurship programs  

**Scale Up**: Full opportunity infrastructure that makes community-controlled prosperity the normal outcome

Each step creates immediate benefits while building toward comprehensive opportunity infrastructure.

## Opportunity Caucus

The [Opportunity Caucus](./opportunity-caucus/) represents our organized approach for advancing opportunity-creating policies across political channels and governance levels, emphasizing economic common ground over political differences.

## How Policy Mechanisms Work

Many of these policy ideas have been working quietly in the background of our governance for decades, known only to bureaucrats and politicians. **The Opportunity Economy** is about connecting these systems to voter activity so you can be part of consciously making them work for you and demanding they be enhanced rather than captured by corporate interests.

Understanding and changing technical details like depreciation rules is how we make capitalism work for everyone, not just those who already have wealth and lobbyists.

## Answering Common Objections

**"This sounds like socialism!"** Opportunity Economics is fundamentally capitalist‚Äîit just makes capitalism work for wealth creation across all levels of society rather than just wealth concentration at the top. We're creating genuine market competition instead of corporate monopolization.

**"Where will the money come from?"** The same place it comes from for military spending, corporate bailouts, and tax cuts for the wealthy‚Äîthe federal government creates it. The question isn't whether we can afford Opportunity Economics, but whether we can afford to keep running an economy designed for wealth extraction.

**"Won't this cause inflation?"** Inflation happens when demand exceeds productive capacity. Opportunity Economics focuses on expanding productive capacity through job guarantee programs, infrastructure development, and community wealth building.
