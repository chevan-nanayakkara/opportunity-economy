# A Progressive U.S. Policy Agenda
*Reshaping American Capitalism Through Technical Mastery*

A collaborative platform for developing comprehensive progressive policy solutions that create wealth-building opportunities for all Americans.

> "The time for detailed, technical progressive action is now."

## Vision

This agenda is built on the belief that capitalism and democracy are both essential to realizing the American Dream. The problem isn't capitalism itself‚Äîit's that the United States has allowed a neoliberal version to dominate, one that concentrates wealth rather than expanding opportunity.

## The Progressive Approach

**Progressive Theory**: Markets produce the outcomes they're designed to produce. Better outcomes require better design through strategic policy.

**Goal**: Broad-based prosperity, robust middle class, sustainable growth, economic resilience.
