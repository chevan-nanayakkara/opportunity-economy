# The Opportunity Economy
*Building Capitalism That Works for Everyone Through Strategic Policy*

A collaborative platform for developing comprehensive policy solutions that create genuine wealth-building opportunities for all Americans through the framework of Opportunity Capitalism.

> "Competition Cures All" and "Democracy and Capitalism: two great tastes that go great together."

## Vision

This agenda is built on the belief that we can create **The Opportunity Economy**‚Äîwhere everyone has genuine opportunities to build wealth and control their economic lives. The problem isn't capitalism itself‚Äîit's that corporate interests have captured our economic systems to extract wealth rather than create opportunities.

## The Opportunity Capitalism Approach

**Core Theory**: Economic systems produce the outcomes they're designed to produce. We can redesign capitalism to work for opportunity creation across all levels of society rather than wealth concentration at the top.

**Goal**: Broad-based prosperity, community-controlled development, systematic wealth-building opportunities, and economic democracy.

## Policy Framework

### The Four Pillars of Opportunity Capitalism

1. **Use Our Full Economic Capacity for Real Opportunity**
2. **Help Working People and Families Build Wealth, Not Just Survive** 
3. **Community Control Over Economic Development**
4. **Economic Security and Political Inclusion That Enables Real Achievement**

## The Coalition

Our approach builds a broad coalition that transcends traditional political divisions:

- **Republicans** frustrated with crony capitalism and corporate capture
- **Democrats** disappointed by corporate-captured incrementalism  
- **Independents** wanting practical solutions beyond partisan gridlock
- **Everyone** who believes working people and families deserve genuine economic opportunities

## How Policy Mechanisms Work

Many of these policy ideas have been working quietly in the background of our governance for decades, known only to bureaucrats and politicians. **The Opportunity Economy** is about connecting these systems to voter activity so you can be part of consciously making them work for you and demanding they be enhanced rather than captured by corporate interests.

## Get Involved

- **Policy Experts**: Help develop detailed mechanisms for systematic opportunity creation
- **Community Organizers**: Connect local needs to national resource capacity
