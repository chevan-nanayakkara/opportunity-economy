# Consumer Depreciation Reform

## Executive Summary

**The Problem**: Current U.S. tax and economic measurement systems create a massive wealth transfer from working families to corporate executives and shareholders through depreciation asymmetries. While businesses receive tax benefits for equipment depreciation, working families get no corresponding protection when their cars, appliances, and electronics lose value—often by deliberate corporate design.

**The Scale**: Since 1950, this systematic barrier has blocked hundreds of billions in wealth-building opportunities for working families while concentrating profits in wealthy pockets through planned obsolescence strategies.

**The Solution**: Implement consumer depreciation credits for working families and reform economic measurements to accurately track wealth redistribution, creating market incentives for durable goods while expanding middle-class wealth-building opportunities.

## Policy Objectives

### Primary Goals

- **Expand Wealth-Building Opportunities**: Enable working families to recover depreciation costs on major purchases, providing thousands annually in wealth-building support
- **Create Market Accountability**: Establish economic consequences for corporations that block wealth-building through designed obsolescence
- **Improve Economic Measurement**: Develop indicators that accurately reflect sustainable prosperity rather than hiding barriers to upward mobility
- **Environmental Benefits**: Incentivize durable goods production, reducing waste and replacement cycles

### Success Metrics

- **Family Wealth Impact**: Average working family saves $2,000-4,000 annually through depreciation credits
- **Product Durability**: Measurable increases in average lifespan of consumer durables
- **Market Response**: Corporate shift toward durability-focused product design strategies
- **Economic Accuracy**: GDP/NDP measurements reflect actual wealth-building capacity

## Legislative Framework

- Develop quarterly "Real NDP" reports showing sustainable economic progress
- Create distributional analysis showing wealth redistribution patterns

#### Alternative Economic Indicators

- **Working Family Wealth Index** tracking middle-class asset accumulation capacity
- **Corporate Concentration Index** measuring profit flow to executives/shareholders vs. worker benefits
- **Sustainability Index** incorporating environmental costs of replacement cycles

#### Regressive Impact Assessments

- Require all major economic policies to include distributional effect analysis
- Mandate depreciation and replacement cost impacts across income groups
- Integrate into Congressional Budget Office scoring processes

## Implementation Strategy

## Call to Action

Consumer Depreciation Reform represents a concrete opportunity for progressives to demonstrate technical policy mastery while expanding wealth-building opportunities for working families. This initiative shows how detailed policy work can systematically reshape capitalism to serve broad prosperity rather than concentrate wealth in corporate hands.

### Next Steps

- **Legislative Champions**: Identify progressive senators and representatives to introduce companion bills
- **Technical Development**: Partner with tax policy experts to refine implementation details
- **Coalition Building**: Engage environmental, consumer, and working family organizations
- **Public Education**: Develop accessible materials explaining wealth transfer mechanisms
- **Pilot Advocacy**: Support state-level right-to-repair and consumer protection initiatives

The question isn't whether we can afford Consumer Depreciation Reform—it's whether progressives can build the political power necessary to challenge comprehensive frameworks designed to block wealth-building for working families while protecting profit concentration for those already wealthy.

This policy initiative demonstrates the kind of detailed, technical progressive action needed to systematically expand opportunity for all Americans while proving progressive capacity for effective governance.
