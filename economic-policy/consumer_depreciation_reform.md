# Consumer Depreciation Reform

## Executive Summary

**The Problem**: Current U.S. tax and economic measurement systems create a massive wealth transfer from working people and families to corporate executives and shareholders through depreciation asymmetries. While businesses receive tax benefits for equipment depreciation, working people and families get no corresponding protection when their cars, appliances, and electronics lose value—often by deliberate corporate design.

**The Scale**: Since 1950, this systematic barrier has blocked hundreds of billions in wealth-building opportunities for working people and families while concentrating profits in wealthy pockets through planned obsolescence strategies.

**The Solution**: Implement consumer depreciation credits for working people and families and reform economic measurements to accurately track wealth redistribution, creating market incentives for durable goods while expanding opportunity for wealth-building across all levels of society.

## Policy Objectives

### Primary Goals

- **Expand Wealth-Building Opportunities**: Enable working people and families to recover depreciation costs on major purchases, providing thousands annually in wealth-building support
- **Create Market Accountability**: Establish economic consequences for corporations that block wealth-building through designed obsolescence
- **Improve Economic Measurement**: Develop indicators that accurately reflect sustainable prosperity rather than hiding barriers to opportunity creation
- **Environmental Benefits**: Incentivize durable goods production, reducing waste and replacement cycles

### Success Metrics

- **Family Wealth Impact**: Average working family saves $2,000-4,000 annually through depreciation credits
- **Product Durability**: Measurable increases in average lifespan of consumer durables
- **Market Response**: Corporate shift toward durability-focused product design strategies
- **Economic Accuracy**: GDP/NDP measurements reflect actual wealth-building capacity

## Legislative Framework

## Call to Action

Consumer Depreciation Reform represents a concrete opportunity to demonstrate how detailed policy work can systematically reshape capitalism to serve broad prosperity rather than concentrate wealth in corporate hands. This initiative shows how **Competition Cures All** - when markets face real accountability for wealth extraction, they naturally shift toward value creation.

### Next Steps

- **Legislative Champions**: Identify senators and representatives across party lines to introduce companion bills
- **Technical Development**: Partner with tax policy experts to refine implementation details
- **Coalition Building**: Engage business, environmental, consumer, and working family organizations
- **Public Education**: Develop accessible materials explaining wealth transfer mechanisms
- **Pilot Advocacy**: Support state-level right-to-repair and consumer protection initiatives

The question isn't whether we can afford Consumer Depreciation Reform—it's whether we can build the coalition power necessary to challenge comprehensive frameworks designed to block wealth-building for working people and families while protecting profit concentration for those already wealthy.

This policy initiative demonstrates the kind of detailed, technical action needed to systematically expand opportunity for all Americans while proving our capacity for effective governance that serves communities rather than corporate interests.
