# A Progressive U.S. Policy Agenda
*Reshaping American Capitalism Through Technical Mastery*

A collaborative platform for developing comprehensive progressive policy solutions that create wealth-building opportunities for all Americans.

> "The time for detailed, technical progressive action is now."

## Vision

This agenda is built on the belief that capitalism and democracy are both essential to realizing the American Dream. The problem isn't capitalism itself—it's that the United States has allowed a neoliberal version to dominate, one that concentrates wealth rather than expanding opportunity.

## The Progressive Approach

**Progressive Theory**: Markets produce the outcomes they're designed to produce. Better outcomes require better design through strategic policy.

**Goal**: Broad-based prosperity, robust middle class, sustainable growth, economic resilience.

## The Framework

Our [Progressive Action Framework](./framework/progressive-action-framework.md) emphasizes:

1. **Master the Technical Details** - Understanding policy mechanisms and implementation
2. **Build Cross-Ideological Coalitions** - Unity around wealth-building opportunities  
3. **Develop Comprehensive Policy Solutions** - Systematic reforms that work together
4. **Execute Strategic Implementation** - From bill language to agency relationships
5. **Scale the Model Across Issues** - Creating systematic advantages over time

## Get Involved

This agenda succeeds through technical expertise applied at scale:

- **Policy Experts**: Share technical knowledge and help develop detailed recommendations
- **Advocates**: Use this framework for comprehensive approaches in your issue area
- **Everyone**: Help expand wealth-building opportunities regardless of your other beliefs

## Migration Steps

1. **Create the repository structure** (folders and files)
2. **Port your main content** to `index.md` and `README.md`
3. **Break out the framework** into separate files
4. **Create placeholder files** for each policy area mentioned
5. **Set up initial discussions** for each major policy area
6. **Add navigation links** between related policies

## Initial Discussion Topics to Create

- "Alternative approaches to monopoly measurement" (based on your HHI work)
- "Consumer Depreciation Reform feedback"
- "Housing policy wealth-building strategies" 
- "Cross-ideological coalition building"
- "Technical mastery in progressive policy"

Would you like me to help you convert any specific sections first, or shall we start with setting up the basic repository structure?
