# A Progressive U.S. Policy Agenda
*Reshaping American Capitalism Through Technical Mastery*

**Last updated: June 25, 2025**  
*This is a living document that will expand as new policy analyses are published*

This framework has inspired new approaches to political organization, including the [Opportunity Party](https://opportunityparty.info), built around creating wealth-building opportunities for all Americans regardless of their beliefs, culture, or lifestyle.

## "Capitalism and Democracy, Two Great Tastes that Taste Great Together"

I believe capitalism and democracy are both essential to realizing the American Dream. Capitalism provides the economic dynamism and individual opportunity that allows people to build better lives. Democracy provides the collective decision-making power to ensure that opportunity is available to everyone. Together, they create the conditions for true freedom, genuine security, and authentic plurality.

The problem isn't capitalism itself‚Äîit's that the United States has allowed a neoliberal version of capitalism to dominate for 50 years, one that concentrates wealth rather than expanding opportunity. Americans complain about capitalism because they experience American capitalism. But capitalism is working just fine for people in countries like Germany, Denmark, and Canada‚Äîthey have successful capitalist economies that work for everyone through better policy design.

As explored in related analysis, the economic theories that justify our current system aren't objective truths‚Äîthey're political choices. Supposedly neutral economic concepts actually favor wealth concentration. And retreating to local organizing while authoritarians capture national institutions is a losing strategy.

## The U.S. Progressive Economic Approach

Progressive policies create opportunities for wealth-building across all strata of American society while removing barriers that prevent upward mobility. This represents a fundamental departure from the neoliberalism that has dominated U.S. politics for decades.

**Neoliberal Theory**: Markets are naturally efficient. Government intervention distorts optimal outcomes.
- *Results*: Massive wealth concentration, stagnant wages, financial instability, weakened middle class

**Progressive Theory**: Markets produce the outcomes they're designed to produce. Better outcomes require better design through strategic policy.
- *Goal*: Broad-based prosperity, robust middle class, sustainable growth, economic resilience

**The Critical Difference**: Neoliberalism assumes markets naturally create opportunity if left alone. Progressives understand that better outcomes require better design through detailed policy work.

## Why Technical Mastery Matters

While progressives debate ideology or retreat to local organizing, authoritarians actively capture U.S. national institutions through detailed policy work. Corporate interests employ armies of lawyers, economists, and policy experts to systematically structure advantages into American law.

U.S. progressives must match this level of technical sophistication. Reshaping the American economy requires mobilizing around knowledge, facts, and detail‚Äînot just high-level rhetoric, but actively reshaping American capitalism through systematic policy work.

## The Progressive Action Framework

### 1. Master the Technical Details
You cannot reshape systems you don't understand. Study actual policy mechanisms, regulatory processes, and implementation details. Build relationships with subject matter experts.

### 2. Build Cross-Ideological Coalitions
Frame issues around expanding opportunity rather than ideological division. Unite working families, fiscal conservatives, business interests, and issue advocates around wealth-building opportunities.

### 3. Develop Comprehensive Policy Solutions
Half-measures get watered down or reversed. Create systematic reforms that work together to reshape market incentives rather than providing temporary relief.

### 4. Execute Strategic Implementation
Good policy ideas die in implementation. Success requires understanding legislative, administrative, and coalition strategies‚Äîfrom bill language to agency relationships.

### 5. Scale the Model Across Issues
Single-issue victories don't reshape capitalism. Apply this framework across multiple policy areas to create systematic advantages over time.

The time for detailed, technical progressive action is now. While authoritarians capture institutions through policy mastery, progressives must do the same‚Äînot to tear down capitalism, but to reshape it so it delivers on America's promise of opportunity for all.
