# Issue Creation Guide
*How to create effective issues for Opportunity Economy policy development*

## Overview

Issues are the primary way we track policy development, coordinate implementation, and enable community collaboration across the Four Pillars of Opportunity Economics. This guide explains how to create clear, actionable issues that advance systematic opportunity creation.

## When to Create Issues

### ‚úÖ **Do Create Issues For:**
- **New policy proposals** - Ideas for policies that advance the Four Pillars
- **Policy improvements** - Enhancements to existing policy frameworks
- **Research requests** - Need for analysis, data, or evidence on specific topics
- **Implementation planning** - Legislative strategy, coalition building, coordination
- **Technical questions** - Specific policy mechanism clarifications
- **Documentation improvements** - Better explanations, examples, or organization

### ‚ùå **Don't Create Issues For:**
- **General questions** - Use [Discussions](../../discussions) instead
- **Basic feedback** - Comment on existing issues or policies
- **Duplicate topics** - Search existing issues first
- **Off-topic content** - Must relate to Opportunity Economics framework
- **Vague suggestions** - Be specific about problems and solutions

## Issue Templates

We provide templates to ensure consistent, high-quality issue creation. Choose the template that best matches your contribution:

### üéØ **Policy Development Template**
**Use for**: New policy proposals, framework development, policy improvements

**Best for**: 
- Proposing new initiatives like "Mandatory Financial Literacy Education"
- Suggesting improvements to existing policies
- Developing new policy frameworks

### üèõÔ∏è **Federal Action Template**  
**Use for**: Congressional legislation, agency rules, executive actions

**Best for**:
- Legislative proposals requiring Congress
- Agency implementation strategies
- Executive action recommendations

### üèõÔ∏è **State Action Template**
**Use for**: State legislation, regulations, pilot programs

**Best for**:
- State-level policy implementation
- Pilot program proposals
- State coordination strategies

### üèòÔ∏è **Local Action Template**
**Use for**: Municipal ordinances, county policies, community organizing

**Best for**:
- Local implementation strategies
- Community organizing approaches
- Municipal policy proposals

## How to Fill Out Templates Effectively

### **Title Guidelines**
Use clear, descriptive titles with prefixes:
- **`[POLICY]`** - New policy proposals
- **`[RESEARCH]`** - Research requests
- **`[IMPLEMENTATION]`** - Implementation planning
- **`[COORDINATION]`** - Multi-level coordination

**Examples**:
- ‚úÖ `[POLICY] Mandatory Financial Literacy and Accounting Education`
- ‚úÖ `[RESEARCH] International Models for Community Development Banking`
- ‚úÖ `[IMPLEMENTATION] Federal Job Guarantee Pilot Program Strategy`
- ‚ùå `Education idea` (too vague)
- ‚ùå `We need better policies` (no specifics)

### **Policy Area Field**
Be specific about which aspect of Opportunity Economics your issue addresses:

**Building Pillar Examples**:
- "Consumer Depreciation Reform"
- "Community Development Banking"  
- "Education and Training Opportunity"
- "Economic Security Foundation"

**Community Power Examples**:
- "Cooperative Development"
- "Local Economic Control"
- "Housing Wealth-Building"

**Market Accountability Examples**:
- "Antitrust Enforcement"
- "Right-to-Repair"
- "Planned Obsolescence Prevention"

**Democratic Inclusion Examples**:
- "Campaign Finance Reform"
- "Economic Security Foundation"
- "Civil Rights Economic Enforcement"

### **Development Type Selection**
Choose **one** that best describes your contribution:

- **New policy framework** - Creating entirely new policy approach
- **Improve existing policy** - Enhancing current policy documents
- **Research/analysis** - Gathering evidence, data, or examples
- **Implementation details** - Execution strategy and coordination
- **Coalition strategy** - Stakeholder engagement and cross-partisan building

### **Government Level Selection**
Choose **all** levels that apply to implementation:

- **Federal** - Congressional action, agency rules, executive orders
- **State** - State legislation, regulations, pilot programs
- **Local** - Municipal/county policies, community organizing
- **Multi-level** - Coordination across government levels

### **Policy Question Section**
This is the heart of your issue. Write a clear problem statement that:

1. **Describes the specific problem** this policy would address
2. **Explains why it matters** for opportunity creation
3. **Connects to the framework** (which pillar, how it advances opportunity)
4. **Includes voting instructions** for community prioritization

**Template Structure**:
```markdown
[Problem description - what specific challenge does this address?]

[Framework connection - how does this advance the Four Pillars?]

[Why it matters - impact on community wealth-building and opportunity]

**Vote for Priority**: React with üëç if you think this should be a development priority for [pillar name].
```

**Example**:
```markdown
Most Americans lack basic financial literacy, making them vulnerable to predatory financial practices and unable to take advantage of wealth-building opportunities like the Consumer Depreciation Reform. Adam Smith emphasized "read, write and ACCOUNT" as fundamental civic skills in Wealth of Nations.

This connects to the Building pillar by providing the foundation knowledge needed for economic security and wealth-building. Without financial literacy, people cannot effectively use opportunity-creating policies or protect themselves from wealth extraction.

Mandatory financial literacy education would enable all Americans to understand depreciation, build wealth systematically, and avoid predatory financial practices that block opportunity creation.

**Vote for Priority**: React with üëç if you think this should be a development priority for the Building pillar.
```

### **Research Needed Section**
List specific information that would help develop this policy:

**Good examples**:
- "Current state financial literacy education requirements and gaps"
- "International examples of successful financial literacy curricula"
- "Economic impact studies of financial literacy on wealth-building"
- "Coordination mechanisms between federal standards and state implementation"

**Avoid vague requests**:
- ‚ùå "General research on education"
- ‚ùå "Look into this topic"
- ‚ùå "Find some examples"

### **Timeline and Expected Outcome**
Be realistic about development timelines and specific about deliverables:

**Timeline examples**:
- "3-6 months for initial research and framework development"
- "6-12 months for comprehensive policy document"
- "18 months for full implementation strategy"

**Expected outcome examples**:
- "Comprehensive policy framework with curriculum standards and implementation mechanisms"
- "Federal legislation draft with coalition strategy"
- "State pilot program design with evaluation metrics"

## After Creating Your Issue

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Add appropriate labels** (see [Label Usage Guide](./label-usage-guide.md))
2. **Share in relevant discussions** to increase visibility
3. **Respond to questions** and feedback promptly
4. **Monitor community reactions** for priority voting

### **Community Voting**
Issues use GitHub reactions for priority voting:
- **üëç (thumbs up)** - Vote for this priority
- **‚ù§Ô∏è (heart)** - Strong support for this initiative  
- **üöÄ (rocket)** - Urgent priority for development

**Encourage voting** by:
- Including voting instructions in your issue description
- Sharing in community discussions
- Explaining how the policy advances opportunity creation

### **Responding to Feedback**
