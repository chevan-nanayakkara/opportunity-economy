# The Opportunity Caucus Platform
## Democratic Party Caucus for Economic Democracy

> "Competition Cures All" and "Democracy and Capitalism: two great tastes that go great together."

### Mission Statement

The Opportunity Caucus is a Democratic Party caucus committed to implementing **The Opportunity Economy** through legislative action and electoral organizing. We are the organized effort within the Democratic Party to turn the Opportunity Economy framework into enacted policy and real-world results.

The Opportunity Economy is a broader movement that transcends party lines, appealing to anyone who believes capitalism should work through fair competition rather than extraction or exclusion. The Opportunity Caucus represents the Democratic Party's implementation arm of this vision—where we build the legislative coalition needed to make these policies reality.

**We are the coalition that elects and holds accountable Democratic legislators** who will implement Opportunity Economy policies. Our power comes from organizing across traditional political divisions while working within Democratic Party structures to deliver concrete economic benefits that help working people, small businesses, and communities build wealth and control their economic lives.

### How the Opportunity Caucus Fits Within the Broader Movement

**The Opportunity Economy Movement**: A comprehensive framework for making capitalism work for wealth creation across all levels of society, developed through collaborative policy research and community organizing. This framework appeals to people across party lines who believe in economic fairness and democratic participation.

**The Opportunity Party**: A broad coalition platform that organizes people across party lines around Opportunity Economy policies, including Republicans frustrated with crony capitalism, independents wanting practical solutions, and Democrats seeking systematic economic change.

**The Opportunity Caucus**: The Democratic Party implementation vehicle for Opportunity Economy policies. We focus specifically on legislative strategy, electoral organizing within Democratic primaries and general elections, and coordination with Democratic Party leadership to advance this agenda.

**Our Unique Role**: While the broader movement develops policy frameworks and builds cross-party coalitions, the Opportunity Caucus provides the focused political infrastructure needed to turn ideas into law through Democratic Party channels. We handle candidate recruitment, legislative strategy, committee coordination, and the systematic work of governing.

### Strategic Framework: Building People Power for Economic Democracy Through Democratic Politics

The Opportunity Caucus represents the **organized Democratic Party infrastructure** needed to implement The Opportunity Economy. While policy experts develop frameworks and broader coalitions build support, **our unique role is building the political power necessary to make change happen through Democratic governance**—the systematic organizing work of turning popular support into Democratic electoral victories and legislative success.

**Why Democratic Party Focus Matters**: The Opportunity Economy requires significant federal policy changes that need unified government action. While the broader movement includes people across party lines, implementing these policies requires coordinated legislative strategy and party discipline. The Democratic Party provides the most viable path for comprehensive Opportunity Economy implementation.

**Target Coalition Within Democratic Politics**: We organize Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who want the party to deliver concrete economic benefits rather than just good intentions. Our coalition includes:
- **Progressive Democrats** seeking systematic economic transformation beyond incrementalism
- **Moderate Democrats** wanting market-based solutions that actually work for working people
- **Rural and suburban Democrats** needing economic policies that help their communities compete
- **Small business Democrats** frustrated with corporate monopolization
- **Working people across demographic lines** who vote Democratic but need economic results

**Realistic Audience Scope**: We focus on Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters who fundamentally believe in economic fairness, democratic participation, and genuine opportunity for all. While we coordinate with cross-party efforts, our primary organizing targets are people already within or inclined toward the Democratic coalition who want the party to be more effective on economic issues.

### Core Principles

**Economic Democracy Through Democratic Governance**: We support capitalism that serves opportunity creation rather than wealth extraction, implemented through effective Democratic Party governance. Markets work best when they're genuinely competitive and accessible to everyone, which requires sustained political commitment to fair rules.

**Systematic Solutions Through Legislative Strategy**: We develop comprehensive policy frameworks that address root causes rather than symptoms, with detailed attention to legislative process, committee strategy, and implementation coordination.

**Coalition Building Within Democratic Politics**: We unite progressive Democrats seeking transformation with moderate Democrats wanting practical solutions, focusing on shared economic interests rather than ideological divisions within the party.

**Evidence-Based Policy Development**: We base our positions on data, research, and proven mechanisms rather than political positioning. We learn from international examples and coordinate with state-level Democratic innovations.

**Execution Excellence Through Party Infrastructure**: We focus on the systematic work of getting things done through Democratic Party channels—building legislative coalitions, managing bills through committee and floor action, coordinating with leadership, and measuring implementation results.

### The Four Pillars of Opportunity Capitalism

#### Pillar 1: Use Our Full Economic Capacity for Real Opportunity

**The Problem**: We're told there's "no money" for job training, infrastructure, or community development while trillions flow to corporate subsidies and military contractors.

**Our Solution**: Deploy our actual productive capacity—workers, materials, organizational ability—to create opportunities where people live and work.

**Key Policies**:
- Federal Job Guarantee creating opportunities in infrastructure, environmental restoration, and care work
- Community-controlled resource allocation serving local needs rather than corporate interests
- Economic development based on productive capacity, not artificial financial constraints

**Democratic Caucus Implementation Strategy**:
- Draft Federal Job Guarantee pilot legislation with specific implementation timelines
- Build bipartisan coalition around infrastructure investment and community development
- Coordinate with Democratic governors and mayors on pilot program design and rollout
- Work with Transportation, Agriculture, and Education committees on sector-specific programs

#### Pillar 2: Help Working People Build Wealth, Not Just Survive

**The Problem**: People lose thousands annually to planned obsolescence while businesses get tax breaks for equipment depreciation.

**Our Solution**: Give working people the same systematic advantages that businesses receive.

**Key Policies**:
- Working People Depreciation Credits recovering thousands annually from forced replacement costs
- Community Development Banking serving local wealth building rather than Wall Street speculation
- Universal Basic Assets ensuring everyone has access to productive tools and ownership stakes
- Market accountability for corporations that design products to fail

**Democratic Caucus Implementation Strategy**:
- Navigate Consumer Depreciation Reform through Ways and Means Committee
- Build coalition of consumer advocates, environmental groups, and fiscal responsibility Democrats
- Coordinate implementation with IRS and state revenue agencies
- Monitor corporate response and market behavior changes through ongoing oversight

#### Pillar 3: Community Control Over Economic Development

**The Problem**: Corporate interests control economic development while communities have no real say in how their economies function.

**Our Solution**: Democratic institutions coordinating economic development based on community needs and priorities.

**Key Policies**:
- Enhanced support for worker cooperatives and employee ownership
- Community Land Trusts with federal backing for affordable development
- Antitrust enforcement creating genuine market competition
- Local banking systems prioritizing community prosperity over profit extraction

**Democratic Caucus Implementation Strategy**:
- Coordinate antitrust legislation with Judiciary Committee leadership
- Build relationships with cooperative development organizations and Democratic community leaders
- Work with rural and urban Democratic representatives on community banking initiatives
- Track implementation of community land trust programs through Housing committee oversight

#### Pillar 4: Economic Security and Political Inclusion That Enable Real Achievement

**The Problem**: Economic insecurity prevents people from taking risks, starting businesses, or engaging in democratic participation.

**Our Solution**: Economic security as the foundation for genuine opportunity and democratic engagement.

**Key Policies**:
- Universal healthcare enabling entrepreneurship and job mobility
- Guaranteed basic income providing foundation for risk-taking and innovation
- Comprehensive childcare and education systems supporting economic stability
- Democratic reforms ensuring fair political participation and ending corporate capture

**Democratic Caucus Implementation Strategy**:
- Coordinate healthcare policy with existing Democratic healthcare initiatives
