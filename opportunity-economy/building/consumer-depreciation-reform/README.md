# Economic Policy Foundation

*Reshaping markets to expand wealth-building opportunities for all Americans*

## Overview

The Economic Policy Foundation represents a fundamental departure from neoliberal market fundamentalism. Rather than assuming markets naturally create opportunity, these policies systematically reshape market incentives to ensure capitalism serves broad-based prosperity rather than wealth concentration.

## Core Principle

**Markets produce the outcomes they're designed to produce.** Better outcomes require better design through strategic policy that creates systematic advantages for wealth-building across all income levels.

## Policy Areas

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### Wealth-Building Focus
Every policy in this section specifically targets expanding opportunities for working families to accumulate assets and build long-term prosperity, rather than simply providing temporary relief.

### Market Accountability
Rather than assuming market outcomes are natural, these policies create systematic incentives for businesses to contribute to broad-based prosperity while maintaining competitive dynamics.

### Implementation Sophistication  
Each policy includes detailed implementation pathways, coalition strategies, and technical mechanisms designed to survive political opposition and bureaucratic capture.

### Evidence-Based Design
Policy mechanisms are based on successful examples from other countries, states, and localities that demonstrate better outcomes through strategic market design.
