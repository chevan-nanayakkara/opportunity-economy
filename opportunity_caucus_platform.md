# The Opportunity Caucus Platform
## Democratic Party Caucus for Economic Democracy

> "Competition Cures All" and "Democracy and Capitalism: two great tastes that go great together."

### Mission Statement

The Opportunity Caucus is a coalition of Democratic legislators committed to building **The Opportunity Economy**—where capitalism works for wealth creation across all levels of society rather than wealth concentration at the top. We believe the Democratic Party's future depends on delivering concrete economic benefits that help working people and families build wealth, start businesses, and control their economic lives.

### Core Principles

**Economic Democracy**: We support capitalism that serves opportunity creation rather than wealth extraction. Markets work best when they're genuinely competitive and accessible to everyone, not rigged by corporate capture and monopolization.

**Systematic Solutions**: We develop comprehensive policy frameworks that address root causes rather than symptoms. Technical mastery and detailed implementation matter more than ideological purity or political theater.

**Broad Coalition Building**: We appeal to Republicans frustrated with crony capitalism, independents wanting practical solutions, and Democrats disappointed by corporate-captured incrementalism. Economic opportunity transcends traditional political divisions.

**Evidence-Based Policy**: We base our positions on data, research, and proven mechanisms rather than political positioning. We learn from international examples and state-level innovations.

### The Four Pillars of Opportunity Capitalism

#### Pillar 1: Use Our Full Economic Capacity for Real Opportunity

**The Problem**: We're told there's "no money" for job training, infrastructure, or community development while trillions flow to corporate subsidies and military contractors.

**Our Solution**: Deploy our actual productive capacity—workers, materials, organizational ability—to create opportunities where people live and work.

**Key Policies**:
- Federal Job Guarantee creating opportunities in infrastructure, environmental restoration, and care work
- Community-controlled resource allocation serving local needs rather than corporate interests
- Economic development based on productive capacity, not artificial financial constraints

#### Pillar 2: Help Working People and Families Build Wealth, Not Just Survive

**The Problem**: Families lose thousands annually to planned obsolescence while businesses get tax breaks for equipment depreciation.

**Our Solution**: Give working people and families the same systematic advantages that businesses receive.

**Key Policies**:
- Working Family Depreciation Credits recovering thousands annually from forced replacement costs
- Community Development Banking serving local wealth building rather than Wall Street speculation
- Universal Basic Assets ensuring everyone has access to productive tools and ownership stakes
- Market accountability for corporations that design products to fail

#### Pillar 3: Community Control Over Economic Development

**The Problem**: Corporate interests control economic development while communities have no real say in how their economies function.

**Our Solution**: Democratic institutions coordinating economic development based on community needs and priorities.

**Key Policies**:
- Enhanced support for worker cooperatives and employee ownership
- Community Land Trusts with federal backing for affordable development
- Antitrust enforcement creating genuine market competition
- Local banking systems prioritizing community prosperity over profit extraction

#### Pillar 4: Economic Security and Political Inclusion That Enable Real Achievement

**The Problem**: Economic insecurity prevents people from taking risks, starting businesses, or engaging in democratic participation.

**Our Solution**: Economic security as the foundation for genuine opportunity and democratic engagement.

**Key Policies**:
- Universal healthcare enabling entrepreneurship and job mobility
- Guaranteed basic income providing foundation for risk-taking and innovation
- Comprehensive childcare and education systems supporting family economic stability
- Democratic reforms ensuring fair political participation and ending corporate capture
