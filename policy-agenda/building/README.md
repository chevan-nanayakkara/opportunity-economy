# Building
*Federal capacity deployment and wealth-building for all Americans*

## Overview

Building represents Pillars 1 & 2 of our framework: "Use Our Full Economic Capacity for Real Opportunity" and "Help All Americans Build Wealth, Not Just Survive." These policies systematically deploy federal resources to create wealth-building opportunities while giving all Americans the same advantages that businesses already receive.

**Our fundamental orientation**: These policies create systems that serve human dignity and enable genuine choice about work and life. Everyone gets minimum subsistence and quality public services, while wealth-building opportunities are available for those who choose upward mobility.

## Core Principle

**Economic systems produce the outcomes they're designed to produce.** We can redesign capitalism to work for opportunity creation across all levels of society rather than wealth concentration at the top. Federal resources should work for community empowerment rather than corporate subsidies.

**Key Insight**: Since 1971, money functions as a tool we create to coordinate economic activity rather than a scarce resource. We can provide minimum subsistence AND quality public services for all, while creating systematic opportunities for those who choose upward mobility.

## The Challenge Building Addresses

We're told there's "no money" for community development, infrastructure repair, or economic security while trillions flow to Wall Street bailouts and corporate subsidies. Meanwhile, people work hard but lose wealth to planned obsolescence while businesses get tax breaks for their depreciation. Economic insecurity forces people into survival mode rather than enabling genuine choice about work and life.

## How Building Advances Opportunity Economics

### Pillar 1: Use Our Full Economic Capacity for Real Opportunity
Federal resources are deployed to create systematic opportunities where people live and work. This includes infrastructure, education, healthcare, and economic security that enable genuine choice rather than forced compliance with extractive systems.

### Pillar 2: Help All Americans Build Wealth, Not Just Survive  
All Americans deserve the same systematic advantages that businesses receive. Tax equity, asset-building opportunities, and worker ownership enable wealth creation for those who choose to pursue it, while ensuring everyone has access to quality public services.

### The Foundation Approach
Building provides the foundation that makes all other pillars possible:
- **Community Power** needs economically secure communities to exercise genuine control
- **Market Accountability** requires consumers with real economic choices
- **Democratic Inclusion** requires people with economic security to participate meaningfully in politics

## Coalition Building Strategy

### Shared Interests Across All Americans
- **Everyone** gets minimum subsistence and quality public services (healthcare, education, training)
- **Those seeking upward mobility** get systematic wealth-building opportunities and pathways
- **Small businesses** benefit from customers with economic security and spending power
- **Communities** gain economic stability that enables long-term planning and investment

### Messaging That Unites Rather Than Divides
- **Economic foundation** - "Everyone deserves minimum subsistence and quality public services"
- **Clear pathways** - "Work and opportunity lead to higher living standards while everyone has access to essential services"
- **Tax equity** - "All Americans deserve the same systematic advantages that big corporations get"
- **Community strength** - "Strong communities need economically secure residents"

### Cross-Partisan Appeal
**For Americans who value free markets**: "True free markets require everyone to have genuine economic choices, not forced participation due to survival needs"

**For Americans who prioritize family values**: "Everyone has access to healthcare, education, and support services, with clear paths to higher living standards through work and opportunity"

**For fiscal conservatives**: "Clear incentive structures with universal access to development resources create long-term economic strength and independence"
