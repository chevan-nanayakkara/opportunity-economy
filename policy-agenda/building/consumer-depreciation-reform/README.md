# Consumer Depreciation Reform

## Executive Summary

**The Problem**: Current U.S. tax and economic measurement systems create a massive wealth transfer from all Americans to corporate executives and shareholders through depreciation asymmetries. While businesses receive tax benefits for equipment depreciation, individuals and families get no corresponding protection when their cars, appliances, and electronics lose value—often by deliberate corporate design.

**The Scale**: Since 1950, this systematic barrier has blocked hundreds of billions in wealth-building opportunities for all Americans while concentrating profits in wealthy pockets through planned obsolescence strategies.

**The Solution**: Implement consumer depreciation credits for all Americans and reform economic measurements to accurately track wealth redistribution. This creates market incentives for durable goods while expanding The Opportunity Economy where capitalism works for wealth creation across all levels of society rather than wealth concentration at the top.

## Connection to The Opportunity Economy Framework

### Four Pillars Integration

**Building (Pillars 1 & 2)**: Consumer depreciation reform demonstrates how we can deploy federal resources (tax credits) to create systematic wealth-building opportunities while giving all Americans the same tax advantages businesses receive.

**Community Power (Pillar 3)**: Creates market incentives for durable goods that serve community wealth-building rather than corporate extraction strategies.

**Market Accountability**: Establishes economic consequences for corporations that block wealth-building through designed obsolescence—**Competition Cures All**

**Democratic Inclusion (Pillar 4)**: Provides thousands annually in additional household resources, enabling people to take risks, invest, and participate more fully in economic and democratic life.

## Policy Objectives

### Primary Goals

- **Expand Wealth-Building Opportunities**: Enable all Americans to recover depreciation costs on major purchases, providing $2,000-4,000 annually in wealth-building support per household
- **Create Market Accountability**: Establish economic consequences for corporations that block wealth-building through designed obsolescence—**Competition Cures All**
- **Improve Economic Measurement**: Develop indicators that accurately reflect sustainable prosperity rather than hiding barriers to opportunity creation
- **Environmental Benefits**: Incentivize durable goods production, reducing waste and replacement cycles while supporting climate goals

### Success Metrics

- **Individual and Family Wealth Impact**: Average household saves $2,000-4,000 annually through depreciation credits
- **Product Durability**: Measurable increases in average lifespan of consumer durables (target: 25% increase in 5 years)
- **Market Response**: Corporate shift toward durability-focused product design strategies
- **Economic Accuracy**: GDP/NDP measurements reflect actual wealth-building capacity rather than extraction cycles

## Legislative Framework

### Primary Legislation: Consumer Depreciation Credit Act

#### IRS Implementation

**Standardized Depreciation Schedules** (Based on realistic product lifecycles):
- Motor vehicles: 7 years (matching business depreciation)
- Major appliances: 10 years (refrigerators, washers, dryers)
- Electronics: 4 years (smartphones, laptops, tablets)
- Furniture: 12 years (matching business office furniture)
- HVAC systems: 15 years (matching business depreciation)

**Administrative Framework**:
- Integrate into existing Form 1040 with new Schedule CD (Consumer Depreciation)
- Make credits fully refundable to ensure all Americans without federal tax liability benefit
- Use existing IRS depreciation calculation systems, modified for consumer goods
- Phase in over 3 years: electronics first (Year 1), appliances (Year 2), vehicles and furniture (Year 3)

**Credit Calculation**:
- Straight-line depreciation method (simple and transparent)
- Maximum credit cap: $4,000 per household annually
- Phase-out begins at $75,000 individual/$150,000 joint income (ensuring broad access)

#### Eligibility Requirements

- Available to households earning up to 400% of federal poverty level (approximately $120,000 for family of four)
- Applies to purchases over $300 (prevents abuse on small items)
- Requires proof of purchase (receipt or warranty registration)
- Products must meet minimum expected lifespan standards (prevents gaming with deliberately cheap goods)

#### Revenue Mechanism (Revenue-Neutral Design)

**Primary Funding Sources**:
- **Close Corporate Depreciation Loopholes**: $35-45 billion annually from multinational corporations using accelerated depreciation for tax avoidance
- **Digital Services Tax**: $15-20 billion from tech platforms that profit from planned obsolescence and data extraction
- **Reduced Government Equipment Costs**: $8-12 billion savings from federal agencies buying more durable goods

**Additional Revenue Tools**:
- **Corporate Accountability Fee**: Companies with products failing significantly before expected lifespan pay fee to consumer protection fund
- **Right-to-Repair Non-Compliance Penalties**: Fines for manufacturers not providing required repair resources

### Secondary Legislation: Consumer Protection and Market Accountability Act

#### Manufacturer Requirements

- **Mandatory Durability Disclosure**: Expected product lifespans, failure rates, and repair costs prominently displayed at point of sale
- **Repair Resource Provision**: Manuals, diagnostic tools, and replacement parts available for minimum 10 years after purchase
- **Right-to-Repair Protections**: Cannot void warranties for independent repairs using manufacturer-provided resources
- **Truth-in-Advertising Standards**: Product durability claims must be substantiated with testing data

#### Market Accountability Mechanisms

- **Consumer Class Action Streamlining**: Enable rapid recovery when products fail significantly earlier than disclosed lifespans
- **Federal Consumer Protection Enforcement Fund**: Financed by corporate accountability fees
- **Planned Obsolescence Penalties**: Civil and criminal penalties for deliberately designing products to fail
- **Independent Testing Standards**: Government-certified testing for product durability claims

## Economic Measurement Reforms

- **Consumer Depreciation Integration**: Include consumer durable depreciation (Dcon) alongside business capital depreciation (Dcap) in quarterly economic analysis
- **Sustainable Prosperity Indicators**: Develop "Real NDP" showing economic growth after accounting for both business and consumer asset depreciation
- **Wealth Distribution Analysis**: Track how depreciation patterns affect different income groups and communities

#### Alternative Economic Indicators

- **Opportunity Index**: Measures actual wealth-building capacity across income levels, not just aggregate economic activity
- **Corporate Extraction vs. Creation Ratio**: Tracks profit flows to executives/shareholders versus community wealth building
- **Durability and Sustainability Index**: Incorporates environmental costs and benefits of product lifecycle changes

#### Policy Impact Assessments

- **Mandatory Distributional Analysis**: All major economic policies must include analysis of wealth-building vs. extraction effects
