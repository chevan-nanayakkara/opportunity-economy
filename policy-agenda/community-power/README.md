# Community Power
*Local control over economic development with adequate federal support*

## Overview

Community Power represents Pillar 3 of our framework: "Community Control Over Economic Development." These policies give communities genuine control over their economic development while accessing national-scale resources. Democratic institutions coordinate development based on community needs and local priorities, enabling genuine local autonomy with adequate support.

**Our fundamental orientation**: These policies create systems where communities control their economic destiny rather than being forced to accept extractive development imposed by distant corporate interests. Local solutions are empowered byâ€”not constrained byâ€”federal resource capacity.

## Core Principle

**Communities shouldn't be forced to choose between local control and adequate resources.** Local solutions are fundamentally constrained by the size of the local economy, but Opportunity Economics provides systematic federal support that enables genuine local autonomyâ€”communities decide how resources are used while accessing national-scale capacity.

## The Challenge Community Power Addresses

Many people frustrated with corporate-controlled development retreat to purely local solutionsâ€”community gardens, local cooperatives, small-scale sustainable projects. While valuable, these approaches are constrained by local resource limitations. Meanwhile, corporate interests freely access national-scale resources through subsidies, tax advantages, and favorable regulations.

Community Power doesn't replace local solutionsâ€”it powers them up. Instead of forcing communities to choose between local control and adequate resources, we provide systematic federal support that enables genuine local autonomy.

## Policy Areas

### ðŸ“‹ Priority Planning

#### Cooperative Development Support
*Community ownership and democratic control of local businesses*

- **Focus**: Worker cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, and multi-stakeholder cooperatives that keep wealth local
- **Impact**: Workers and community members as owners and decision-makers, not just employees or customers
- **Key mechanisms**: Conversion financing, technical assistance, tax advantages for cooperative development
- **Community control**: Local ownership prevents wealth extraction by distant shareholders

#### Local Economic Control Mechanisms
*Community decision-making over economic development priorities*

- **Focus**: Democratic institutions that give communities real voice in how their economies develop
- **Impact**: Local residents control development rather than having decisions imposed by distant interests
- **Key mechanisms**: Community development districts, participatory budgeting, local investment funds
- **Community control**: Resource allocation based on community priorities rather than corporate profits

#### Regional Development Planning
*Connecting communities to opportunities without extracting from them*

- **Focus**: Multi-community coordination that strengthens rather than weakens local control
- **Impact**: Communities working together while maintaining local autonomy
- **Key mechanisms**: Regional compacts, shared infrastructure, coordinated economic development
- **Community control**: Communities choose collaboration rather than having coordination imposed

#### Small Business and Entrepreneurship Enhancement
*Local business development that serves community needs*

- **Focus**: Entrepreneurship that strengthens local economies rather than extracting wealth
- **Impact**: Community members as business owners and wealth-builders
- **Key mechanisms**: Local lending funds, business incubators, procurement preferences
- **Community control**: Businesses owned by and accountable to local communities

#### Housing Wealth-Building Policy
*Community-controlled housing development that builds local wealth*

- **Focus**: Housing as community wealth-building opportunity rather than speculation commodity
- **Impact**: Individuals and families building wealth through homeownership and community land trusts
- **Key mechanisms**: Community land trusts, first-time buyer support, speculation prevention
- **Community control**: Communities control housing development rather than distant speculators

#### Broadband and Rural Opportunity
*Digital infrastructure that connects communities without controlling them*

- **Focus**: High-speed internet as public utility that enables local economic development
- **Impact**: Equal access to digital economy and remote work opportunities
- **Key mechanisms**: Municipal broadband, rural broadband expansion, digital equity programs
- **Community control**: Communities own and control their digital infrastructure

#### Trade Policy with Community Focus
*International agreements that serve local communities*

- **Focus**: Trade that expands local opportunities rather than facilitating wealth extraction
- **Impact**: Communities benefit from rather than suffer from international economic integration
- **Key mechanisms**: Labor mobility protections, domestic content requirements, supply chain resilience
- **Community control**: Trade policies serve community needs rather than just corporate profits

#### Immigration as Workforce Development
*Immigration policy that strengthens communities through economic integration*

- **Focus**: Immigration as community workforce development and economic opportunity
- **Impact**: Both immigrants and existing residents benefit from economic integration
- **Key mechanisms**: Skills-based integration, community sponsorship, local workforce development
- **Community control**: Communities shape immigration integration based on local needs and priorities

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### Community Control with Adequate Resources
Every policy ensures communities have genuine decision-making power over their economic development while accessing federal resources adequate to their needs and ambitions.

### Local Ownership and Wealth-Building
These policies prioritize keeping wealth and ownership local rather than allowing extraction by distant corporate interests, while connecting communities to broader economic opportunities.

### Democratic Economic Development
Communities make democratic decisions about their economic priorities rather than having development imposed by corporate interests or distant bureaucrats.

### Connection to Economic Security Foundation
Community Power works best when residents have economic security through the Building pillarâ€”people with minimum subsistence and quality public services can participate meaningfully in community economic planning.

## How Community Power Advances Opportunity Economics

### The Scale Mismatch Problem
Purely local solutions are constrained by local economic capacityâ€”a community can only support as many cooperatives or local enterprises as local income allows. This forces communities to compete against corporations with access to national-scale resources.

### The Community Power Solution
Community Power provides systematic federal support that enables genuine local autonomy. Communities get adequate resources while retaining control over how those resources are used. This creates the best of both worlds: local democratic control with national-scale capacity.

### Connection to Other Pillars
- **Building**: Federal resources flow to communities rather than corporations, while economically secure residents can participate in local planning
- **Market Accountability**: Local businesses face community accountability rather than just shareholder pressure
- **Democratic Inclusion**: Political participation includes meaningful voice in local economic development

## Coalition Building Strategy

### Shared Community Interests
- **Local business owners** benefit from community-controlled development and local ownership preferences
- **All residents** gain from community control over housing, infrastructure, and economic development priorities
- **Rural communities** get adequate resources for broadband, infrastructure, and economic development
- **Small towns** can compete effectively against corporate chain stores and distant developers

### Community-Centered Messaging
- **Local control** - "Communities should control their own economic development priorities"
- **Keep wealth local** - "Local ownership prevents wealth extraction by distant corporate interests"
- **Community choice** - "Local residents should have real voice in development decisions that affect their lives"
- **Adequate resources** - "Communities deserve federal support without federal control over local priorities"

### Cross-Partisan Appeal
**For Americans who value local control**: "Communities know their needs better than distant bureaucrats or corporate executives"

**For Americans who support small business**: "Local ownership and community-controlled development create opportunities for local entrepreneurs"

**For Americans concerned about corporate power**: "Community control prevents corporate extraction while enabling local wealth-building"
