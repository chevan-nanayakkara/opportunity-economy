# Democratic Inclusion
*Economic security and political inclusion that enables real achievement*

## Overview

Democratic Inclusion represents Pillar 4 of our framework: "Economic Security and Political Inclusion That Enables Real Achievement." These policies create the foundation for genuine democratic participation by ensuring everyone has economic security and meaningful voice in the systems that affect their lives, particularly economic policy-making.

**Our fundamental orientation**: These policies create systems where economic security enables political participation and democratic voice ensures economic policies serve community interests rather than corporate extraction. Everyone gets minimum subsistence and quality public services, while democratic institutions include everyone in economic decision-making.

## Core Principle

**Economic security isn't the enemy of opportunityâ€”it's the foundation that makes real opportunity possible.** When people have healthcare, education, and housing security, they can take meaningful risks, pursue genuine opportunities, and participate fully in democratic life. Fair competition requires fair rules, and fair rules require democratic participation by everyone affected by those rules.

## The Challenge Democratic Inclusion Addresses

Economic insecurity forces people to accept bad deals and prevents them from pursuing opportunities, starting businesses, or building community wealth. Meanwhile, political systems exclude most people from meaningful participation in decisions that affect their lives, particularly economic policy decisions that determine whether communities thrive or face extraction.

Corporate interests capture political processes to ensure economic policies serve profit maximization rather than community benefit, while economically insecure people cannot afford to participate meaningfully in political processes that could change these dynamics.
